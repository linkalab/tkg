# README FOR VALIDATION OF KG 

Tests are produced for [Competency Questions](competency_questions.txt), [Error Provocation](error_provocation.txt) and [Inference Verification](inference_verification.txt).


### External SPARQL end point to support validation

We use [Fact Forge project](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/demoservices/factforge-explore-linked-open-data/) from Ontotext as a federated endpoint for SPARQL Queries.
